# Credit Risk Analysis: IFRS 9 ECL Model  
**Author:** Sebastian Gonzalez  

## Project Overview  
This project implements IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss (ECL) modeling using the Credit Risk Dataset from Lao Tse (Kaggle). Key components:  
- **Probability of Default (PD)** estimation.  
- **Loss Given Default (LGD)** and **Exposure at Default (EAD)** calculation.  
- ECL computation for financial reporting compliance.  

## Repository Structure 
- `data/` — Holds the credit risk CSV file (not versioned if large).
- `notebooks/` — Contains Jupyter notebooks (data exploration, modeling, IFRS 9 calculations).
- `README.md` — Provides an overview of the project.

## Setup Instructions  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
    git clone https://github.com/sebastian-gm/credit_risk_IFRS9_ECL_model.git
